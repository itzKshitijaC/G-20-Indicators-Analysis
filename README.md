# Prerequisiteüîç
#### Ensure the "wbdata" library is installed

#### World Bank Data API:
- The World Bank offers a comprehensive repository of data on global development, encompassing economic, social, and environmental indicators for various countries and regions.
- This data can be accessed programmatically via the World Bank API, which facilitates integration into data analysis workflows.

#### wbdata Library:
- wbdata is a Python wrapper for the World Bank API, simplifying the process of retrieving data without directly handling API requests.
- It provides functions to search for indicators, fetch data, and convert it into pandas DataFrames for analysis.
  
# Introduction ‚úíÔ∏è
The project aims to leverage the wbdata library to access and analyze development data from the World Bank, focusing on G-20 countries within a specified date range. By utilizing the wbdata library, the project simplifies the process of retrieving high-quality economic, social, and environmental indicators from the World Bank's extensive repository. Targeting the G-20 countries, a group of major economies allows for a comparative analysis of development trends among these influential nations. The analysis is confined to the period from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, enabling the examination of recent trends and changes. The project involves converting the retrieved data into pandas DataFrames for further manipulation and visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and seaborn. Additionally, the project will leverage Power BI for advanced data analysis and visualization. By importing the processed data into Power BI, the project aims to create interactive dashboards and reports that provide deeper insights and facilitate better decision-making. This approach facilitates a comprehensive analysis of development indicators, providing valuable insights into the progress and challenges faced by the G-20 countries during the specified timeframe.
