### 3. Imports Vs. Exports by Average Poverty Rate
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/itzKshitijaC/G-20-Indicators-Analysis/assets/168798073/7a7c1e71-5c0d-4d51-a7a4-2e166c7de9ff" height="HEIGHT">
</div>

The scatter plot titled "Imports vs. Exports by Average Poverty Rate" illustrates the relationship between trade balances (imports and exports) and the average poverty rate across G-20 countries. The X-axis represents the value of imports in billions of dollars, while the Y-axis represents the value of exports in billions of dollars. Each point on the scatter plot corresponds to a country, with the size of the point indicating the average poverty rate: larger points signify higher poverty rates and smaller points indicate lower poverty rates.

 Countries positioned above the diagonal line (where exports equal imports) have a trade surplus, meaning they export more than they import. Countries below this line have a trade deficit, importing more than they export. This visualization highlights the trade balances of G-20 countries, showing which countries are net exporters or net importers.

 The size of each point provides an additional dimension, indicating the average poverty rate. For example, a country with high exports but a large point size may have significant trade success but still struggle with higher poverty rates. Conversely, smaller points in the surplus area suggest that some countries effectively use their trade surplus to maintain lower poverty rates.

 The scatter plot may reveal outliers, such as countries with very high exports but also high poverty rates, suggesting that trade benefits are not evenly distributed within the country. It also shows trends where countries with balanced trade have varying poverty rates, indicating that factors other than trade balances also significantly impact poverty.
